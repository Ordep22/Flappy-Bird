Hi.&nbsp;üëãüèª &nbsp;**Well come.**&nbsp;

<br>

Welcome to the project Flappy Bird with Python and Machine Learning offered by the [HashTag Treinamentos]([https://www.hashtagtreinamentos.com/]). 
This repository contains a project for the Flappy Bird game developed using the Python programming language. The game was implemented using the Pygame library, offering an authentic Flappy Bird experience. The objective of the game is to control a bird and navigate through obstacles, avoiding collisions. The source code is organized into classes and utilizes features like sprites and animations to create an immersive experience. 
This project presents a great opportunity to learn about Python game programming and explore concepts such as physics, collision detection, and game logic.

<br>

**This project addresses concepts such as:**

1. Class implementation.

2. Access to directories and files using the Os library.

3. Developing a 2D game with the Pygame library.

4. Implementing the Random library to generate random positions.
